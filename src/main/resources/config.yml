file-version: 2.1

# The database-type option has been removed for now. The only options were JSON and SQLite.
# JSON support has been removed because I did not like how it was implemented, and it was very difficult to build on to. The default and only option is SQLite, however I plan
# on implementing some more options in the future

# Enabling these filters will prevent staff from creating honeypot blocks that AREN'T in the respective list below.
filters:
  blocks: false
  inventories: false

# These filter inventory openings and creation of honeypot blocks on inventories. If the filter is enabled and a player tries to open an Honeypot block that has an inventory
# not listed here, they will be allowed to open it without actions being taken. If they try to break the Honeypot, action WILL be taken (Unless block filters are enabled)
allowed-inventories:
  - CHEST
  - FURNACE

# This filter only prevents creation of these types of honeypots. If a honeypot has been previously created but is not a part of the filter, actions will still apply
# This is to prevent honeypots from being created but not removed upon breaking
